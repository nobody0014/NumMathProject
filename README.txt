Numerical Method Project
1) Noise removal


Progress:
1) can remove noise from the athing.wav file like in audacity
	1.1) can’t remove the rest of the noise because there are several, the one inside
	is probably pink noise

You can see the graph if you open the jupyter-notebook showing the reduced noise.
You can even play the two sounds. 
Don’t have time to do more.
Using the same range, audacity also remove the same noise. (Yea we did waste a lot of time)
